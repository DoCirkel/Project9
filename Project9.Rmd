```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Scope 

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!


## Map

```{r leaflet}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
map <- map %>% addMarkers(lat = 53.230106, lng = 6.531911, popup = "I am here!")
map
